    "## Overview: Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute some people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, such as murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question about deterrence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Through our exploration, does instituting a death penalty for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 3, we completed the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 1, we explored the data.\n",
    "2. In section 2, we tested a null hypothesis that murder rates were equally likely to go up or down each year, as if by a flip of a fair coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you do not remember lab 3, we highly recommend you go back and review it now. It will help you for this lab. **\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 4, we will complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 3, we'll apply a similar test to see whether U.S. states that suddenly ended or reinstituted the death penalty were more likely to see murder rates increase than decrease.\n",
    "2. In section 4, we'll run some more tests to support claims that we had been investigating in previous sections. \n",
    "3. In section 5, we'll try to answer our question about deterrence using a visualization rather than a formal hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data source for this project comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crimes are committed by people, not states, we need to account for the number of people in each state when we're looking at state-level data.  Murder rates are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{murder rate for state X in year Y} = \\frac{\\text{number of murders in state X in year Y}}{\\text{population in state X in year Y}}*100000$$\n",
    "\n",

    "### A Natural Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to attempt to investigate the causal relationship between the death penalty and murder rates, we're going to take advantage of a *natural experiment*.  A natural experiment happens when something other than experimental design applies a treatment to one group and not to another (control) group, and we have some hope that the treatment and control groups don't have any other systematic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our natural experiment is this: in 1972, a Supreme Court decision called *Furman v. Georgia* banned the death penalty throughout the US.  Suddenly, many states went from having the death penalty to not having the death penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, let's see how murder rates changed before and after the court decision.  We'll define the test as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Population:** All the states that had the death penalty before the 1972 abolition.  (There is no control group for the states that already lacked the death penalty in 1972, so we must omit them.)  This includes all US states **except** Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Treatment group:** The states in that population, in the year after 1972.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Control group:** The states in that population, in the year before 1972.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Null hypothesis:** Each state's murder rate was equally likely to be higher or lower in the treatment period than in the control period.  (Whether the murder rate increased or decreased in each state was like the flip of a fair coin.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Alternative hypothesis:** The murder rate was more likely to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our alternative hypothesis is in keeping with our suspicion that murder rates increase when the death penalty is eliminated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Technical Note:* It's not clear that the murder rates were a \"sample\" from any larger population.  Again, it's useful to imagine that our data could have come out differently and to test the null hypothesis that the murder rates were equally likely to move up or down.\n",
