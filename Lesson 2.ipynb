    "An observational study is one in which scientists make conclusions based on data that they have observed but had no hand in generating. It is often difficult to seperate confounding factors in this study, so there is no way to generate a causal relationship.  In experiments, through careful set-up and use of control groups and randomization, it may be possible to create a causal relationship. "
